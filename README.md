# TicTacToe_in_Python

In this project i used this website as my starting point: https://thepythoncode.com/article/make-a-tic-tac-toe-game-pygame-in-python
I ended up using their icon assets and, i used their script at the bottem of the website as my baseline to base my game off.

How ever i'm actively adapting the code to my own project and i plan on intergrating machine learning to play the O side of the game.
