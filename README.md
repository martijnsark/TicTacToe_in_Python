# TicTacToe_in_Python


## credits:
In this project i used this website as my starting point: https://thepythoncode.com/article/make-a-tic-tac-toe-game-pygame-in-python

I ended up using their icon assets and, i used their script at the bottom of the website as my baseline to base my game off.

<br><br>

## the goal:

I'm actively adapting the code to my own project and i plan on integrating machine learning to play the O side of the game.

<br><br>

## the software i used:

I'm using Visual studio code as my GUI.
  - I added the environment i made on Anaconda through CTRL + SHIFT + P and then selected "select interpreter"
  - I added "Pygame" through this "pip install pygame" command in the terminal that is linked to my Anaconda environment.
  - I added the Python plug in.

I'm using Anaconda as my package manager.

Currently no machine learning of any kind has been added.

## how do i execute the code?

You will need to enter the following every time you open Visual studio code to establish the folder you're working in:

cd "insert directory"

Now that the directory meets you wil need to enter the following code every time you want to execute you're code:

python .\"InsertPyGameTitle.py"
