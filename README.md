# TicTacToe_in_Python


## credits:

### the first game version:

In this project version i used this website as my starting point: https://thepythoncode.com/article/make-a-tic-tac-toe-game-pygame-in-python

I ended up using their icon assets and, i used their script at the bottom of the website as my baseline to base my game off.

I also used icons from icons8 so to credit them here's there link: icons8.com

this concludes the credits of the first version which includes:
- tictactoe.py
- tictactoe.ipynb
- the images in the "images" folder

### the second game version:



<br><br>

## the goal:

I'm actively adapting the code to my own project and i plan on integrating machine learning to play the O side of the game.

<br><br>

## the software i used:

I'm using Visual studio code as my GUI.
  - I added the environment i made on Anaconda through CTRL + SHIFT + P and then selected "select interpreter"
  - I added "Pygame" through this "pip install pygame" command in the terminal this was than applied to my Anaconda environment.
  - I added the Python plug in.

I'm using Anaconda as my package manager.
- I added Jupyter Notebooks
- I added Qt console

Currently no machine learning of any kind has been added.

## how do i execute the code of Version-1?

I created two ways depending on how you want to use this project:
- 1 using the .ipynb file
- 2 using the python file

Both scripts in my version use a Anaconda Environment with packages and if you're code doesn't work check the section above "the software i used"

## 1:

Download all files in this project.

Open the .ipynb file and click on the execute arrow.

The code for the .ipynb file only executes the code that is in the tictactoe.py file.


## 2:

You will need all files except the tictactoe.ipynb file.

You will need to enter the following every time you open Visual studio code to establish the folder you're working in:

cd "insert directory"

Now that the directory meets you wil need to enter the following code every time you want to execute you're code:

python .\"InsertPyGameTitle.py"
